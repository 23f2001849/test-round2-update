# Overview

This is a simple HTML page titled 'Task Manager'. The page contains an input field and a button for adding tasks. Below these controls is an unordered list where the tasks are displayed.

# Setup

No particular setup is required. You just need an internet browser to open the HTML file.

# Usage

Open the HTML file with a web browser to view the page. The page contains a title, an input field for entering tasks, a button for adding tasks, and an unordered list for displaying the tasks.

To add a task, simply type the task into the input field and click the 'Add' button. The task will then appear in the list below.

# Improvements

In this version, we've added an input field and a button that allow the user to add tasks to the list. When the 'Add' button is clicked, the task entered in the input field is added to the list and the input field is cleared.
